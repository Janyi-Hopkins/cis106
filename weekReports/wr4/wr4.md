*    **Current directory:** The directory that you are in at the moment.
*    **parent directory:** The directory that contains the directory that you are working in.
*    **the difference between YOUR HOME directory and THE HOME directory:** Your home directory is reached through terminal emulator for you to use and the home directory is accessible to all users.
*    **pathname:** Indicates the location of the file in the filesystem.
*    **relative path:** The location of a file starting from the current working directory or from a directory inside the current working directory.
*    **absolute path:** The location of a file starting at the filesystem.
